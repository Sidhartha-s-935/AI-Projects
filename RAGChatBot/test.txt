“When the guns roar, the arts die,” said celebrated playwright Arthur Miller. Many art masterpieces have been swallowed up by wars but art, like the ever-forgiving land that has caused countless battles, has withstood it all. It has been the blank canvas to paint everything from propaganda films to anti-war movies. While many of them resort to skewed agendas, director Rajkumar Periasamy takes the road less travelled with Amaran, and along with producer Kamal Haasan and powerhouse performances from Sivakarthikeyan and Sai Pallavi, the filmmaker delivers an evocative biopic of Major Mukund Varadarajan.
Who is Major Mukund Varadarajan? The real-life hero behind Sivakarthikeyan’s Amaran

The perfectly titled Amaran is everything we expected it to be. While we know about the war that came in the form of an operation in which Major Mukund was killed in action, Amaran builds up to it by showcasing the battles Mukund (played by Sivakarthikeyan) and his lady love Indhu Rebecca Varghese (Sai Pallavi) had in their personal and professional lives amidst their beautiful love story.

Technically, Amaran would make for a near-perfect biographical war film but at its heart, it is an endearing love story. Partly fiction and mostly adapted from a segment of ‘India’s Most Fearless: True Stories of Modern Military Heroes’, Amaran journals the lives of Mukund and Indhu from the first time they met at college. Of course, the film follows the template of the tried and tested romance story with everything from meet-cute, convincing the families and entering into wedlock. But the army backdrop, set in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, makes the film stand apart.

Apart from the beautiful love story, Amaran offers a glimpse into a counter-insurgency/terrorism battalion and their everyday lives. Rajkumar Periasamy isn’t new to the game of bringing to life the everyday actualities of a group of people; his fantastic debut Rangoon (2017) was about Tamil Burma repatriates and similarly, in Amaran, the filmmaker puts us right in the middle of the action and reaction of our soldiers.

What works in the favour of Amaran is how it stays with its characters instead of dwelling at length on the history and politics behind the territorial conflict over the Kashmir region. We get throwaway lines on how those who are supposed to sit and talk are yet to do it and even a glimpse into the ‘other’ side when militants face losses. From a cinematic standpoint, Amaran, to our pleasant surprise, is more akin to Vaaranam Aayiram than Vishwaroopam. Though our counterparts in the North have a richer history when it comes to the genre of war films, some of the recent Bollywood outings reek of jingoism hastened by hypernationalism and xenophobia. Amaran avoids such pitfalls like an expert soldier manoeuvring across a minefield.
Rajkumar Periasamy on Sivakarthikeyan’s transformation for ‘Amaran’
Amaran (Tamil)
Director: Rajkumar Periasamy
Cast: Sivakarthikeyan, Sai Pallavi, Bhuvan Arora, Rahul Bose, Geetha Kailasam 
Runtime: 169 minutes
Storyline: A fearless soldier and his spirited lady love face their battles with courage and brave it all out

Without throwing military jargon at us, the film skillfully teaches us concepts like white and black villages, why certain battalions are allowed to grow facial hair and how the Indian Army works closely with camps for reformed militants. Another line, “Suspect all but respect all”, mouthed by the dependable Rahul Bose, embodies the means through which the army operates in sensitive areas.

It wouldn’t be an overstatement to call Sivakarthikeyan and Sai Pallavi the pillars that prop up this film. Sivakarthikeyan’s introduction shot featuring a planking competition with two soldiers standing on his back lingers in the mind. More than the physical transformation — which makes him look the best he has ever looked on screen — it’s the restrained performance of Siva that makes it one of his most career-defining roles. His character’s braveness is underlined by his persona rather than an assembly of heroic moments. While Siva aces through the action sequences, he’s in his element in scenes where his character is vulnerable — and that happens often, be it when his team is ambushed or when his love story hits a roadblock.

If Sivakarthikeyan is the heart of the film, pumping blood that accelerates through our veins during the action sequences, it’s Sai Pallavi who happens to be the soul of Amaran. The resilient Indhu Rebecca Varghese compares their long-distance relationship with that of the sky and the sea. While Mukund, with desires and passion like the boundless sky, flies high as a kite, it’s Indhu who, like the serene sea, endures the brunt of their relationship’s rocky start and the solo responsibilities of being a parent while simultaneously being the source of power for Mukund’s perilous journey. In the hands of a less capable actor, the chances of Indhu coming off as a one-dimensional turning the film into a sobfest were painfully high but Sai Pallavi aces it.

Apart from the lead pair, who complement each other well, Geetha Kailasam shines the most as Mukund’s mother. The thoughtful decision to stick to a not-so-familiar cast makes it easier to see them as characters, lending a sense of legitimacy to the story. The lighter moments — like the romance montages or the scenes showcasing the brotherhood within the force, including a sequence where the soldiers discuss their favourite films from Thuppaki to Anbe Sivam — add depth to the characters which may otherwise feel superficial.

While shedding light on the personal and professional tribulations a soldier faces, the film is primarily an ode to the family members and what they go through after sending their loved ones to the army. The brilliant writing overshadows the minor flaws of Amaran and while I’m personally not a fan of films reusing yesteryear titles, this one happens to be a rare case where it feels befitting to the newer film. With Amaran, Rajkumar Periasamy hits it out of the park once again thanks to a pacy screenplay, marvellous performances and brilliant technical prowess, especially from GV Prakash who, apart from accentuating the mass sequences with rousing music, skillfully uses silence during the poignant moments.

Vijay handed over the ‘thuppaki’ to Sivakarthikeyan in GOAT as a gesture to announce his successor in Tamil cinema, and with Amaran, Sivakarthikeyan shows us that the gun is in safe hands.

 ‘Raayan’ movie review: Dhanush’s fiery bloodfest offers only dwindling returns
In his sophomore directorial, Dhanush attempts to turn an ordinary story into something more with a well-written setting and measured storytelling, but falls disappointingly short

Droplets of water fall on the cheek of a newborn girl, lying on a priest’s lap, as her lanky elder brother, dripping water from head to toe, names her ‘Durga.’ In mere days, she would witness him spill blood, forced to shed the boy in him, be smeared of a sin he would never cleanse himself of, and lead a life amongst fire and death.

Raayan, actor-director Dhanush’s second directorial, begins with this well-conceived sequence that sets the tone right. Composer AR Rahman tugs at your heart as you see Kathavarayan a.k.a Raayan, his two young brothers, and an infant sister, flee their town and arrive in Madras. With the help of Sekar (Selvaraghavan), they find refuge and means of survival. Is Sekar just a gentle-hearted stranger, or did he see something in Raayan’s eyes and wish he better be on his side? We are never told, but our guesses might align with the latter.

In the present day, shouldering fatherly responsibilities, Raayan (Dhanush) owns a fast-food shop to help Maanickavel Raayan (Kalidas Jayaram) with his college studies and get Durga (Dushara Vijayan) married soon. Muthuvel Raayan (Sundeep Kishan), however, is a bratty, impulsive, alcoholic who gets into petty fights and has to wait for his brother to bail him out. Even his paramour, Meghala (Aparna Balamurali) has to muster energy, or drown a drink, to put up with his aggravating behaviour.

In any other neighbourhood, Muthu would have faded into the setting as a common deadbeat. A charming song sequence in which he drinks, dances and jollies around with Meghala shows the life he would have led had he not lived on a turf where a war is brewing between two rival gangs; one headed by Dorai (Saravanan) and the other, by Sethuraman (SJ Suryah). At the centre of this world is a whirlpool of murder, debauchery, feud, politics and power, a quagmire that Raayan has repeatedly warned them not to get pulled into. Making matters thicker is a cop (Prakash Raj) who throws a wedge in between these gangs, for personal vengeance.

Director: Dhanush
Cast: Dhanush, SJ Suryah, Sundeep Kishan, Dushara Vijayan, Kalidas Jayaram
Runtime: 145 minutes
Storyline: A patriarch has to protect his family when they inadvertently get muddled in a war between two rival gangs

Establishing a measured setting with effective treatment, the filmmaker in Dhanush promises to turn an ordinary storyline into something more. For instance, his own introduction shot is not the ‘mass cinema’ entry you would expect, but a wide shot of him cooking Chinese food. Dhanush cloaks his character with a lot of mystery, with his ominous, brooding persona painting an opaque image of who he is behind those still eyes.

But to much dismay, this is all we get to know about him in the film, and the writing of his character contributes to Raayan falling short of all its promises, opting for a worn-out route, and ending up on a disappointing note. To understand how this happens, take for instance his cult classic, Pudhupettai, directed by Selvaraghavan; Kokki Kumar’s terrific character arc showed him as a powerless man taking on a Goliath who gives him a day’s notice to survive. Meanwhile, one small mistake leads Anbu, in Vetri Maaran’s Vada Chennai, to get entangled amidst a gang war. Raayan is also pulled into the gutter against his wishes, but here he is constantly on the offence, bringing death to the feet of his enemies, with no deadlines or deals to stop him. This is a character that faces no overpowering obstacle, and centring an indestructible character such as this leaves fewer options for the screenplay to do anything remotely noteworthy.

In writing the lead characters, Dhanush goes the Ramayana route to introduce some metaphors; Raayan is designed after Raavana, Muthuvel after Kumbhakarna, and Maanickavel after Vibhishana. Durga is Shurpanakha, who the film seems to say, has all the right to be a ‘Durga.’ Such attributes seem interesting on paper, but Raayan aside, the other characters become mere puppets to the plot, their voices muffled. SJ Suryah gets criminally underutilised, and his character becomes a stock antagonist with no aptitude to back his villainy.

There is hardly any space in the second half for any of the drama we saw early on, and many of the actions of the other lead characters end up unjustified. Of course, in a set-up such as this, a lead character must suffer a tragedy to trigger the response, but Dhanush could have done better than using the typical Tamil cinema cliché here.

However, even during the insipid events in the second half — which is just one bloody kill after the other — A. R. Rahman’s terrific background music and Om Prakash’s cinematography keep you engaged. The DOP attempts to redefine a genre we have become accustomed to with how he lights his frames. Opting for neon and warm lighting, he highlights the characters as powerless humans unaware of the darkness they are consumed by.

With the number of gangster dramas we have been getting over the past decade, and with films splattering their frames with blood just to follow the trend, you expect something novel from the likes of Dhanush. Raayan, however, neither holds up to the standards of the actor in Asuran nor the director in Pa Paandi.
